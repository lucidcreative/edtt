Refactor and fix the EduGauge app with the following updates:

1. Teacher Management / Earn Tab

The Teacher Management features need to be merged into the Earn tab.

Option A: Keep the Earn tab and place all teacher management functionality inside it.

Option B: Remove the Earn tab completely and retitle the Teacher Management tab to “Earn.”

Ensure the tab title, routes, and icons are updated consistently across the app.

2. Data Consistency Across Tabs

Fix issues where switching between tabs shows inconsistent classroom data.

Example: The Announcement page shows one classroom while the Dashboard shows another.

Ensure that the active classroom context is synced across all tabs, pulling from the same source (likely a ClassroomContext or useUser state).

3. Assignment Management (Teacher User)

The Assignment Management tab inside the teacher view is currently just loading and not rendering data.

Fix the query or API call so assignments load correctly.

Add proper loading states (spinner, skeleton UI) instead of infinite loading.

Ensure teachers can add/edit/delete assignments without errors.

4. Analytics Integration

Move the Analytics tab into the Leaderboard tab.

The Leaderboard tab should now have:

Leaderboard section (ranking students by performance, badges, tokens, etc).

Analytics section with detailed breakdowns:

Student login duration vs clocked-in time

Time spent on assignments

Participation in challenges/group buys

Overall classroom usage metrics

Add toggle or sub-tabs inside Leaderboard to switch between "Leaderboard" and "Analytics."

5. Feature Integrity / Error Handling

Ensure every button and feature works as expected.

Currently, adding a student manually to a classroom throws an error. Fix the API route and schema validation for student creation.

Add front-end validation for forms (e.g., required fields, invalid input).

Display clear error messages to teachers/students when something fails (not just generic errors).

Confirm that Marketplace, Trade, Announcements, Assignments, Badges, Challenges, Group Buys all execute their actions without silent failure.

6. Testing & Reliability

Add integration tests to confirm that switching tabs always displays the correct data context.

Add seed data for assignments, announcements, badges, and students to test interactions faster.

Ensure error logs in console give descriptive messages (e.g., "Add student failed: missing email field").
