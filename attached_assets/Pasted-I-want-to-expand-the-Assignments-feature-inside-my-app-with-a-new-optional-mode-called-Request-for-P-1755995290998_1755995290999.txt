I want to expand the Assignments feature inside my app with a new optional mode called Request for Proposal (RFP).

Requirements:

Teacher Workflow:

When creating an assignment, teachers should have the option to mark it as an RFP Assignment.

For RFP Assignments, instead of students just submitting completed work, they must first submit a proposal.

Teachers can view all submitted proposals in a dashboard/table format.

Teachers can approve one proposal to officially award the "contract" (the assignment).

Once a proposal is approved, the chosen student is assigned the work, and the other proposals are marked as “not selected.”

Student Workflow:

When viewing an RFP Assignment, students see a "Submit Proposal" button instead of a normal “Submit Work” option.

Students can write a short pitch/plan and submit it.

Once submitted, they should be able to see the status of their proposal: Pending / Approved / Not Selected.

UI Features:

In the Assignments tab, RFPs should be visually distinct (e.g., with a badge or icon).

Teachers should have a simple Proposal Review Dashboard that lists all student proposals, sortable by student name, submission time, etc.

Teachers should have a one-click way to approve a proposal (with confirmation).

Database & Backend:

Extend the existing assignment schema with an isRFP flag.

Create a new Proposals model/table with fields like:

id

assignmentId (FK to Assignment)

studentId

content (proposal text)

status (Pending, Approved, Not Selected)

createdAt, updatedAt

Ensure that approving one proposal automatically updates the others to “Not Selected.”

Extra Features:

Notifications: When a teacher approves a proposal, notify the selected student.

History: Teachers can see which proposals were submitted for each RFP, even after one is selected.

Deliverables:

Frontend components for proposal submission, proposal review, and assignment creation with RFP toggle.

Backend routes and controllers for creating proposals, fetching proposals, and approving a proposal.

Database migrations/updates for new schema.

Integration into the Assignments tab without breaking existing workflows.
