I want to expand my classroom app with a new Economy & Marketplace section. Please implement the following features in a modular, scalable way:

1. Trading Tab (Peer-to-Peer Exchange)

Add a new “Trading” tab in the student dashboard.

Students can offer up any item they’ve bought from the Store.

Other students in the same class can browse trade offers and propose a swap.

Both students must confirm for the trade to be completed.

No tokens are exchanged in this mode — only item-for-item trades.

UI: Trading tab should have two sections:

My Trade Offers (items I’ve listed for trade).

Available Trades (items listed by classmates).

2. Marketplace (Token-based, OfferUp style)

Inside the same “Economy & Marketplace” tab, add a Marketplace section.

Students can list items they’ve bought from the store.

When listing an item:

They can only set/edit the price (in tokens).

They cannot edit the item name, description, or image (pulled directly from the store item).

Buyers see a marketplace feed of available items with price, seller info, and a Buy Now button.

When a buyer purchases:

Tokens are withdrawn from buyer’s account.

Tokens are deposited into seller’s account.

The item is transferred to the buyer’s inventory.

UI: Marketplace should look similar to OfferUp/Facebook Marketplace with item cards.

3. Group Buy System (GoFundMe style inside Store)

Teachers can mark certain store items as Group Buy Items.

Group Buy Items display a progress bar showing how many tokens have been pledged vs. total needed.

Students can contribute any amount of tokens toward the goal.

When the goal is reached:

The group buy item is “unlocked” for the class (e.g., pizza party, field trip, extra recess).

Teacher gets notified that the group goal is complete.

If goal isn’t reached, tokens remain pledged until teacher cancels or the deadline passes.

UI: Group buy pages should resemble GoFundMe with a progress tracker, contributor list, and call-to-action button.

Database Changes:

Add TradeOffers table:

id, classroomId, studentId, itemId, status (Open, Completed, Cancelled).

Add MarketplaceListings table:

id, itemId, sellerId, price, status (Active, Sold).

Add GroupBuys table:

id, itemId, teacherId, goalAmount, currentAmount, contributors[].

Extra:

Notifications:

When someone accepts a trade offer.

When an item is purchased in the marketplace.

When a group buy goal is reached.

Security:

Prevent double-spending or multiple concurrent purchases of the same item.

Ensure only students with enough tokens can buy/contribute.
