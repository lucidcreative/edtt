Teacher Dashboard Fixes & Enhancements
1. Earn Tab – Assignment Creation

Teachers currently cannot add assignments for students.

Add functionality so teachers can create assignments directly from the Earn tab.

Assignment form must include:

Title

Description

Optional link field (teachers can attach a URL to the assignment).

Remove the “Special Project/Proposal” button from the Earn tab — proposals already have their own page.

2. Time Tracking Enhancements (Teacher Dashboard)

Currently, the time tracking feature only shows analytics. Teachers need full control.

Add teacher controls for time tracking:

Set token earnings per hour (custom rate per class).

Set maximum allowed clock-in time per student per day.

Option to pause/disable clock-in for the whole class (in case of holidays, breaks, etc.).

Add logging so teachers can see when students clock in/out, with timestamps.

Add option for teachers to manually adjust a student’s clocked hours (in case of errors).

3. Student Management – Manual Add Bug

Manual add student still fails with 500 error.

Debug and fix backend issue:

Ensure database insertion works correctly.

Check validation (e.g., duplicate student, missing fields).

Return clear error messages instead of generic 500.

After fix, teachers should be able to add students individually without error.

4. Mobile & Tablet View Uniformity

On mobile and tablet views, the tabs/menus should match desktop view exactly.

Side menu should always contain the same items across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Maintain uniform layout and navigation across all breakpoints to reduce confusion.

5. (Optional Nice-to-Have Improvements)

Add success/error notifications (toast or modal) whenever teachers create assignments, add students, or update time tracking settings.

Provide teachers a summary dashboard showing:

Active assignments

Total tokens distributed

Student participation rates

✅ Deliverables:

Assignments fully working in Earn tab (with optional link).

"Special Project/Proposal" removed from Earn tab.

Time tracking enhanced with teacher controls (rate, max time, pause, manual adjust).

Manual student add bug fixed (no more 500 error).

Uniform navigation across desktop, mobile, and tablet.

Clear notifications and error handling added.
