Teacher Dashboard, Leaderboard, Badges/Challenges, Announcements, and Student Roster Fix
1. Leaderboard & Student Roster

Ensure all students in the class roster appear in the leaderboard and all student-related views.

The leaderboard must dynamically reflect every student in the class, not just a single student.

Metrics (tokens, completion rate, badges, challenges) must update consistently for all students.

2. Teacher Dashboard — Announcements

Teachers can create, edit, delete, and schedule announcements.

Scheduled announcements: allow teachers to set a date/time to auto-publish.

Students can view announcements only (no edit/delete).

Announcements should display on the dashboard in a clear, accessible list.

3. Badges & Challenges (Teacher Dashboard)

Remove pre-populated badges/challenges; teachers now select and add items manually from the dashboard.

Each badge or challenge should be:

Editable: title, description, points/tokens, criteria.

Toggleable: can be turned ON/OFF without deletion.

Removable: teachers can delete items if needed.

Students can only view badges/challenges assigned to them; cannot create, edit, delete, or toggle items.

4. Permissions & Role Restrictions

Teachers: full CRUD on announcements, badges, challenges, assignments, RFPs.

Students: view only; can interact with permitted items (e.g., submit assignments, purchase store items), but cannot create/edit/delete anything.

Enforce server-side authorization so students cannot bypass UI restrictions.

5. Data Consistency

Ensure all components use a single source of truth for students, assignments, badges, challenges, RFPs, and announcements.

Any update in the dashboard should reflect immediately across all tabs (Leaderboard, Badges, Challenges, Assignments, RFPs).

6. Templates / Store

Teachers can select badges/challenges from templates or create new ones.

“Use Template” button must successfully add the selected template to the active dashboard tab.

Items added via templates must be editable, toggleable, and removable by teachers.

7. QA & Testing Requirements

Verify all students in the roster appear in Leaderboard and student lists.

Teacher can create, edit, delete, and schedule announcements; student view is read-only.

Teacher can add badges/challenges manually or via template, edit all fields, toggle items on/off, and remove them.

Students can only view assigned badges/challenges.

Ensure real-time updates — any change in the dashboard reflects immediately across all relevant tabs.

Confirm server-side authorization prevents students from performing teacher-only actions.

Verify no console errors or broken fetch calls during normal use.

Validate mobile and desktop UI for all added/edited features.

8. Deliverables

Updated dashboard UI (teacher and student views) with described functionality.

Editable and toggleable badges/challenges inside leaderboard.

Full CRUD for announcements with scheduling capability.

All student data consistently reflected across leaderboard and tabs.

QA test results confirming all functionality works as specified.
